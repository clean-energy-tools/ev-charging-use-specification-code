teaser: Project registration is tied to a single obligated party and records project-level information such as funding source and amounts. Projects are limited to a single physical address but may cover many individual charging port deployments. Station registration (based on address) is recorded in parallel with project onboarding. While a project is limited to a single station, a station may receive funding from multiple projects over time. If a second project is applied to a station that is already in the system, then it should be linked to the existing station rather than generating a new station entry.
