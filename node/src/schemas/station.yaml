#### From an e-mail sent by AtlasPublicPolicy

# As mentioned in replies to your other comment, we have adopted
# the federally preferred nomenclature of station (which is
# a collection of ports at a single location and is synonymous
# with 'site' in your proposed hierarchy rather than EVSE)
# and port (which is not explicitly a cord but the system
# that can supply power to a single vehicle. I.e, a port may
# have more than one cord if it supplies power to two different
# connectors through the same power supply, and both cords are
# not usable at the same time.)

# Also, as noted in another response, because EVSE configurations
# vary, we do not include EVSE as a distinct reporting unit.
# We recognize this has limitations, especially as it pertains
# to ports that share a single power supply. Those limitations
# will be addressed in an update, though likely through the
# same port-based reporting structure.
